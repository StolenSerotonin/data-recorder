# Ignore Pattern Format <http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format>
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Build

# The main build directory created by build.sh
software/**/build/
BUILD.json

# webapp

node_modules/
software/device/webapp/.env
#
# The node package size-plugin writes a file even when 'writeFile:
# false' is set. Ignore 'size-plugin.json' until the bug is fixed.

# Data Recorder Configuration Files
#
# Note: Patterns migrated from device/.gitignore and docs/research/
# Use of the file configure.py was removed in favour of
# [device-]config.json in commit e957afb2 2020-10-08 and its use
# elsewhere (e.g. docs/research/) is deprecated.
