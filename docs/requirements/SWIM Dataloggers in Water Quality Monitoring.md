# Regional council use of continuous data loggers in water quality monitoring

The use of continuous loggers for water quality monitoring and investigations was discussed at the last SWIM meeting (3rd & 4th of May 2017). I also collated information of the LAWA website and contacted Environment Southland, the Otago Regional Council and the Greater Wellington Regional Council for information on their programmes.

In summary (Tables 1 and 2):

Many councils use sediment autosamplers, continuous DO sondes and turbidity loggers on a ‘roaming’ / investigation basis. Some councils (GW, ES, ORC, Horizons) started to use optical sensors for nitrate. ORC and ES reported good results for optical sensors, but not for ion selective electrodes (IS). Challenges are power supply and flow adjustment of continuous data. All lake buoys in shallow coastal lakes seem to include a phycocyanin (PC) sensor as proxy for cyanobacteria. Some trials are underway for continuous monitoring of E.coli (ColiMinder). Continuous monitoring has rarely been required as consent monitoring. A detailed list of equipment used by regional councils can be found in Table 3.

Additional notes from the SWIM meeting:

- NIWA is conducting a review of the ORC’s long term water quality monitoring.
- Dean Olson from the ORC pointed out issues comparing spot measurements vs. continuous data, as even the time of day the samples were collected can matter.
- Exo-NO3 was not recommended by GWRC, but others are happy with the YSI-Exo products in general.
- NIWA is trialling ColiMinder in Porirua for 3 years, Andrew Hughes and led by Megan Oliver at GWRC.
- NIWA is looking at relationship between turbidity and clarity in rivers to E. coli concentrations (Rob D-C).

| **Southland** | Manapouri (planned) shallow coastal lake (planned) | &#x26AB; |  |  |  |  |

**Note:** Water quality buoys (Full WQ) usually measure DO, temperature, chla, phycocyanin (PC) as proxy for cyanobacteria for coastal lakes, and can include lake level, conductivity, salinity and turbidity.
