# Battery Fuel Gauge Retrospective and Lessons Learnt

## Research we did - summary of datasheets

Backgound investigation was completed and compiled into a LaTeX doucment found in issue #15. By looking through the datasheet for the BQ34Z110, it was realised that the flash memory on the chip would need to be configured for our particular application to work. I2C communication with the chip would need to be implemented for communication between the onboard ESP-32 microprocessor and the BQ34Z110, there was plenty of examples of how this communication
could be achieved.
